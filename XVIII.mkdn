While I was busy with arming myself, I wasn't so busy that I did not notice what
the others were doing to prepare. Lisa in particular--- seeing her work
gave me a healthy amount of respect.

I was smart, I spotted things other people didn't, my conclusions were (usually) solid.

Lisa pulled facts out of thin ass.
